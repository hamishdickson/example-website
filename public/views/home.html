                <p>Welcome to snowbear.co - a collection of ramblings, bits of code and other things it would be best if you
                didn't read</p>

                <p><span class="update-header">Hamish, 13th Aug 2014:</span> So it shouldn't suprise anyone that knows me that
                I've hardly done much on this! One person put it nicely by saying "Hamish ... nice guy, attention span on a gopher"!
                Anyway, my excuse is I've spent a huge chunk of my free time working on a webapp for work ... and not being paid for
                it. Hmmm dubious I know ..</p>

                <p>Anyway, I've updated this slightly and will do so over the next few days with the aim to set up a section of my
                crazy person ramblings (aka a blog).</p>

                <p><span class="update-header">Hamish, 20th July 2014:</span> So here we are, doing another rebrand, using
                    what to us is a new and exciting technology (Angular.js). From this, I'm hoping to be able to offer much
                    richer web apps.</p>
