            <p class="lead animated bounceInUp">Welcome to snowbear.co! A tiny London based software company!</p>

            <p class="lead animated bounceInUp">Right now, I'm looking for projects to build my portfolio - if you're
            based in the Balham/Tooting Bec/Wandsworth area of London and would like a website built for free* then
            please get in touch!</p>

            <p class="lead animated bounceInUp">*Well kind of free, there are a couple of conditions: if you like the
            site, then I'd appreciate a nice comment on my linkedIn profile. I also won't be able to host the site for
            you, but I can show you how to do that. Lastly, I'd prefer to do free work for those who can't afford to pay
            - maybe it's your first business or you're a charity?</p>
