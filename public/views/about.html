            <h4>Snowbear Software</h4>

            <p>Snowbear started out of a "great idea for a startup" that I (Hamish) had a few years ago, slowly I
            realised that actually my "great idea for a startup" had not only already been done, but been done very
            well.</p>

            <p>I'm planning to write a blog post on my "great idea" - don't get too excited,
            <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">BOINC and SETI</a> did it far better,
            long ago.</p>

            <p>Anyway, so my new project is to build this site so it's a useful collection of tutorials and blogs.</p>

                <h4>About Hamish</h4>

                <p>I guess this is my site and my company! I'm a geek at heart who is passionate about two things:
                    learning
                    new stuff and building things.</p>

                <h5>My code</h5>

                <p>You can find a lot of my publically available code <a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson"
                                                                         target="_blank">over here on github</a></p>


                <h5>Education</h5>
                <h6>Imperial College London, MSci Physics with Theoretical Physics 2002-2006</h6>

                <p>My undergraduate life was spent avoiding labs at all costs and finding new maths and techniques to
                    solve problems. I'm
                    still totally fascinated by anything quantum field like or anything involving turbulence.</p>

                <h6>Imperial College London, MSc Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces 2006-2007</h6>

                <p>Basically, this is string theory and all the bits you need to understand it. I loved this course -
                    sadly I didn't
                    get to stay on and do a PhD, but wow, I wish I had.</p>

                <h5>"Proper job"</h5>

                <p>Like any good superhero, I have a day job -
