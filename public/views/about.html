    <h4>snowbear.co</h4>

    <p>Snowbear started out of a "great idea for a startup" that I (Hamish) had a few years ago, slowly I
        realised that actually my "great idea for a startup" had not only already been done, but been done very
        well.</p>

    <p>I'm planning to write a blog post on my "great idea" - don't get too excited,
        <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">BOINC and SETI</a> did it far better,
        long ago.</p>

    <p>Anyway, so my new project is to build this site so it's a useful collection of tutorials and blogs.</p>

                <h4>About me in brief</h4>

                <h5>TL; DR</h5>

                <p>Hi! I'm Hamish and I'm a geek. I use java and HTML/CSS by day and nodejs and python by night, if you
                only need to know 3 things about me they should be:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <div>
                    <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-3x"></i>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>I'm always learning</h5>

                    <p>It's really important to me that I stay challenged and keep learning things. I actually
                        consider a day without learning a wasted day.</p>

                <div>
                    <h5>I love to code</h5>

                    <p>I'm great at breaking problems down and solving them - coding is great for that</p>

                <h4>More about me</h4>

                <h5>What interests me</h5>

                <p>Right here, right now - webapps. I've written a couple of single page webapps for work and I'm
                    really
                    enjoying it.</p>

                <p>In the longer term, I'm very interested in modeling large and complex systems, machine learning
                    and anything that I can learn.</p>

                <h5>What I'm good at</h5>

                <p>I'm very good at the "Hamish - we need this doing, can you work it out for us?" jobs. I have lots
                    of experience with big SQL databases and pulling information out quickly.</p>

                <h5>Learning</h5>

                <p>It's really important to me that I stay challenged and keep learning things. I actually
                    consider
                    a
                    day without learning a wasted day, so here is what I'm looking at right now:</p>

                        <li>Clojure</li>

                <p>I love to work as part of a small team. About 6 people seems to be perfect - everyone understands
                    what is going on and it's enough people for different ideas to come about.</p>

                    <h5>Where I'd like to be in 5 years</h5>

                    <p>I'd love to work for a small start up. I'm great at building things from scratch and I think
                        a new startup would be an ideal place for me to work.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">

                    <h5>Where I'd like to be in 10 years</h5>

                    <p>It's hard to say. I love coding and maths, so ideally something that will allow me to keep
                        doing that.</p>

                <h5>Non-geeky stuff</h5>
                <p>I'm really passionate about coding and learning new things, but realistically you can't do that 24/7
                and absorb it all - I like to get away from it all by going to the gym and lifting these heavy things up
                and down. I'm also really into my rugby and lacrosse.</p>

                <h5>Education</h5>

                <h6>Imperial College London, MSc Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces 2006-2007</h6>
                <p>Basically, this is string theory and all the bits you need to understand it. Great fun, if you
                    ever
                    want to lose a couple of hours, ask me about it!</p>


                <h6>Imperial College London, MSci Physics with Theoretical Physics 2002-2006</h6>
                <p>My undergraduate life was spent avoiding labs at all costs and finding new maths and techniques
                    to
                    solve problems. I'm
                    still totally fascinated by anything quantum field like or anything involving turbulence.</p>


                <h6>Rossett School, Harrogate, 1997-2002</h6>
                <p>A-levels: Maths (A), Further Maths (A), Physics (A)</p>
